# Ye Olde Shoppe

Let's suppose we have a storefront. Included in this repo are files containing our transaction history for the last month (`./data/transactions.json`) and our inventory and user lists (`./data/data.json`). Our goal is to run some analytics on those.

1. Write classes to get the included tests (`./tests.rb`) passing
1. Feel free to write more tests as you like to add more functionality to your classes
1. Use those classes to answer the following questions (and update this README)
